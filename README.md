# RCBotSven5
New Angelscript RCBot for Svencoop 5 test

Bot currently walks around and shoot using most weapons (don't use secondary fire yet)
Imported tons of waypoints from RCBOT1 (some are corrupt... or maps have changed since)

waypoints for osprey and sc_another are working, others haven't tested

WIP!!!

# Editor

Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

# Usage

save all files to svencoop/scripts/plugins/BotManager (overwrite current scripts)

open default_plugins.txt

add "BotManager" plugin

	"plugin"
	{
		"name" "RCBot"
		"script" "BotManager/BotManager"
		"concommandns" "rcbot"
	}
	
when running type

	as_command rcbot.waypoint_load

to load waypoints, and....

	as_command rcbot.addbot

to add a bot 

# Waypointing

Waypointing currently only works on listen server

# Adding a waypoint

Use the command

    as_command rcbot.waypoint_add

Paths will be created automatically between nearby waypoints, however they may be sub-optimal. So you may need to add paths manually or remove bad paths.

# Add a path

Go to the first waypoint and use the command

    as_command rcbot.pathwaypoint_create1

then go to the second waypoint and use the command:

    as_command rcbot.pathwaypoint create2

# Remove a path

Go to the first waypoint and use the command

    as_command rcbot.pathwaypoint_remove1

then go to the second waypoint and use the command:

    as_command rcbot.pathwaypoint remove2

# Deleting a waypoint

    as_command rcbot.waypoint_delete
